# Backend Learning Repo

This repo contains code examples and files I used while learning backend development. 

## Node.js

The `app.js` file contains a basic Express app with the following:

- Routes for `/api/v1/tours` and `/api/v1/users` 
- Connecting to a MongoDB database 
- Controllers for handling user requests
